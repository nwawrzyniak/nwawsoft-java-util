# nwawsoft-java-nwawsoft
A package with simple additional Java functions and data structures.

Data structures include List, Stack, Queue, Tree, Graph and more.

Provides a ton of additional functions for native data types (mainly char and String).

This is the go-to library to include in any project if you want to start fresh with a lot of tools and up your sleeves.

Requests for functions that are general enough to be included in a standard library are welcome and should be posted as an [Issue](https://github.com/nwawrzyniak/nwawsoft-java-util/issues).

This code mess is a mix of fresh, clean, well-documented code and over 10 year old school project snippets. I do not take any warranty for the usage of this library, though I intend to maintain this library as well as possible. Coding style may vary in quality and comments and documentation may vary in quality and existance, mostly depening on the when the code was written. Currently the library is getting a complete overhaul.
