# nwawsoft-java-nwawsoft
A package with simple additional java functions for almost or not even close to everything.
Mainly provides implementation of basic data structures such as List, Stack, Queue, Tuple, Tree and Graph.
Also provides a ton of additional functions for native data types (mainly char and String).

This code mess is a mix of fresh, clean, well-documented code and over 10 year old school project snippets.
I do not take any warranty for the usage of this library, though I intend to maintain this library as well as possible.
Requests for function that are general enough to be included in a standard library are welcome and should be posted as an [Issue](https://github.com/nwawrzyniak/nwawsoft-java-util/issues).

This is the go-to library to include in any project if you want to start fresh with a lot of additional functions and data structures.

Coding style may vary in quality and comments and documentation may vary in quality and existance, mostly depening on the when the code was written.
